## üë®‚Äçüíª Profile

Software developer with a First-Class Honours degree in Computer Science and 10+ years of experience across full-stack development, AI-driven applications, and cybersecurity. I‚Äôve collaborated with developers linked to OpenAI and worked with some very well known¬† retail brands. I have also built innovative projects that integrate AI and cybersecurity techniques.

## My philosophy

> **‚ÄúThe code is not the problem ‚Äî the teaching is the problem.‚Äù**

If you know code, you can code in anything. With this in mind, I believe we can adapt to any programming language or environment, fix issues by reading the machine‚Äôs feedback, and constantly seek new challenges. I am currently focusing on penetration testing and cloud security certifications and building innovative projects.
